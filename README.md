# Discount Calculator

This Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount, based on the original price and discount percentage provided by the user. 

## Functionality

- The program prompts the user to enter:
  - The original price of the item.
  - The discount percentage to apply.
- If the discount percentage is **20% or higher**, the program applies the discount and calculates the final price.
- If the discount percentage is **less than 20%**, the original price remains unchanged and is displayed.

## Usage

1. Run the program.
2. Input the original price when prompted.
3. Input the discount percentage.
4. The program will calculate and display the final price, either with the discount applied or the original price if no discount qualifies.

## Example

```
Enter the original price of the item: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25
The final price after applying the discount is: 75.0
```
